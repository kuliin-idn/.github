# KULI.IN

Kuli.In is a revolutionary innovation that combines the expertise of foremen, builders, and architects in one collaborative platform. In combination, Kuli.In not only offers building and repair services, but also brings artificial intelligence (AI) to provide a more efficient and quality experience.

By using Kuli.In, users can easily order services from the Kuli team consisting of foremen, builders, and architects. The main advantage of this application is the AI feature that provides recommendations for the best materials for construction or repair projects. The AI is also capable of generating building sketches and exterior designs, giving users the option to choose an architectural design that suits their liking.

Not only that, Kuli.In also gives users the flexibility to purchase architectural designs that have been created by professionals within the app. Users can also draw their own design ideas using AI assistance, providing a creative and personalized experience in the planning process.

One of the other interesting features is the ability for users to purchase materials directly through the Kuli.In app. This not only eases the material procurement process, but can also help users manage project budgets more effectively.

With an ambitious vision, Kuli.In aims to support the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) number 8 and 9.
